  Have 7+ years of hands-on experience in DevOps, with a strong emphasis on automation, infrastructure as code, and CI/CD pipelines.

  With a proven ability to lead and manage small technical teams, I am focused on ensuring project alignment and timely delivery.
  Being patient and ready to share my knowledge, I lead mentorship initiatives for my colleagues to enhance the team expertise and overall project results.
